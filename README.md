# stklng

stklng is a stack based interpreted programming language

source code and execution are divided into blocks, which work similar to functions in other languages. 

# to use

to build from source:
    You need the c3 compiler    
    then you can simply run
```console
$ make
```

or just download the release (linux only for now)

afterwards you can run .sl files with 
```console
$ ./stklng path_to_file.sl
```
