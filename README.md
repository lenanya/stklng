# stklng

stklng is a stack based, minimalistic interpreted programming language

# to use

### build from source

You need the c3 compiler https://github.com/c3lang/c3c
   
then you can simply run

```console
$ make
```

or

```console
$ make install
```

to install it to `/usr/bin` so it's on your path

### prebuilt binaries
download the release (linux only for now)

afterwards you can run .sl files with 
```console
$ path_to_stklng_executable/stklng-linux64 path/to/file.sl
```
